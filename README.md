# Spam-Classification
Worked on a large datasets of Email messages that have two labels i.e Ham and Spam. I predicted that using Stemming it gives me a better accuracy that Lammetization. Also I have implemented TFDIF Vectorizer on Bag Of Words for a better result. And I use Naive Bayes model for prediction.My accuracy is 98.47 % on Email Spam Classification dataset
